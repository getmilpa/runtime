/**
 * The real probe: one TCP connect to `127.0.0.1:<port>` with a 250 ms timeout.
 *
 * Its scope is the IPv4 loopback address ONLY. A service that listens on `::1` alone, on another
 * interface, on a remote host or inside a Docker network the host cannot reach reports `down` here
 * even though it runs — the probe measures "does this port answer on 127.0.0.1", nothing wider,
 * and a reader says so next to the state ({@see self::host()}).
 *
 * A refused or timed-out connection is `false`, never an exception — a service that is down is a
 * state a reader reports, not an error it raises. It says nothing about WHAT answered:
 * a port that accepts is "up" even if something else took it, which is exactly what the operator
 * needs to know first.
